After working as an IT technician for the city of Westmount, he completed a bachelors degree in Computer Science. For advanced electives, he chose to broaden his knowledge as much as he could, going for classes in topics such as 3D, networking, artificial intelligence and computer vision. He then followed up with a year as a consulting developer for CGI, where he improved his overall skills. He has the expertise to develop applications in many languages, while also being able to work on either front or back end without a hitch."
